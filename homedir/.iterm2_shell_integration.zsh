    # There are three possible paths in life.
    #
    # 1) A command is entered at the prompt and you press return.
    #    The following steps happen:
    #    * iterm2_preexec is invoked
    #      * PS1 is set to ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1
    #      * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is set to 1
    #    * The command executes (possibly reading or modifying PS1)
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 is set to PS1 (as modified by command execution)
    #      * PS1 gets our escape sequences added to it
    #    * zsh displays your prompt
    #    * You start entering a command
    #
    # 2) You press ^C while entering a command at the prompt.
    #    The following steps happen:
    #    * (iterm2_preexec is NOT invoked)
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * iterm2_before_cmd_executes is called since we detected that iterm2_preexec was not run
    #      * (ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 and PS1 are not messed with, since PS1 already has our escape
    #        sequences and ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 already has PS1's original value)
    #    * zsh displays your prompt
    #    * You start entering a command
    #
    # 3) A new shell is born.
    #    * PS1 has some initial value, either zsh's default or a value set before this script is sourced.
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is initialized to 1
    #      * ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 is set to the initial value of PS1
    #      * PS1 gets our escape sequences added to it
    #    * Your prompt is shown and you may begin entering a command.
    #
    # Invariants:
    # * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is 1 during and just after command execution, and "" while the prompt is
    #   shown and until you enter a command and press return.
    # * PS1 does not have our escape sequences during command execution
    # * After the command executes but before a new one begins, PS1 has escape sequences and
    #   ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 has PS1's original value.
