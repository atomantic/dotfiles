# \\[._.]/ - Hi, I'm the MacOS bot

I will update your MacOS machine with Better™ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps that my developer friends find helpful.

You don't need to install or configure anything upfront! This works with a brand-new machine from the factory as well as an existing machine that you've been working with for years.

## Remap Caps-Lock
- I highly recommend remapping your Caps Lock key to Control per [Dr. Bunsen](http://www.drbunsen.org/remapping-caps-lock/):
